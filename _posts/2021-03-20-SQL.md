### SELECT
```
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### SELECT DISTINCT
- statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
```
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
```

### WHERE
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```
SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE Country='Mexico';
```
### AND, NOT, OR
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
```

### SUBSTRING
```
SUBSTRING (<Column>, <Start> , <Length> ) 
```

### IN 
- case-insensitive
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

e.g., HackerRank SQL Weather Observation Station 8-11
```
# Query the non-depulicated list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 

# Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
# index -1 only works in MySQL
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, -1, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 

# Query the non-depulicated list of CITY names NOT starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 
```

### COLLATE
- You can make your query case sensitive by making use of the COLLATE keyword.
```
SELECT A 
FROM MyTbl 
WHERE A COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS = 'ABCdef'
```

### ORDER BY 
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

### COUNT, SUM, AVG, FLOOR, CEIL, MAX, MIN, ROUND, POWER, SQRT
- Only used in selection block
- 'Is' is one equal sign "=", not two "=="
```
# Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 1000000.
SELECT COUNT(ID)
FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION>100000;

SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT='California';
```
- `ROUND(number, decimals, operation)`
- `POWER(number, power)`

### REPLACE in str
`SELECT REPLACE('SQL Tutorial', 'T', 'M');`: replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring, the search is case-insensitive.

```
# works in mysql even when salary is an integer field, not a string field
# From the documentation "In MySQL, NUMERIC is implemented as DECIMAL, so the following remarks about DECIMAL apply equally to NUMERIC.", but CAST doesn't accept NUMERIC as target type (unlike DECIMAL).
# CAST not working in mysql here

# Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: correct-miscalculated average monthly salaries) from Employees db. Round to next integer
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(salary, '0', '')))
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```

### MySQL Not Support xx<A<xx
```
# Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. 
# Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places. 

SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE 38.7880<LAT_N AND LAT_N<137.2345;
```

NOT working when write `38.7880<LAT_N<137.2345`.

### LIMIT

HackerRank: Weather Observation Station 15, 16
```
# Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than . Round your answer to  decimal places.
# MySQL

SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N<137.2345
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
LIMIT 1; 
```
HackerRank: Weather Observation Station 17
```
# Note MIN(LAT_N) cannot be used in WHERE block
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4)
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N>38.7780
ORDER BY LAT_N ASC
LIMIT 1;
``` 

### Multiple SQL
Select second highest salary 
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```
