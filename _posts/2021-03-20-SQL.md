### IFNULL
`IFNULL(expression, alt_value)`: The `expression` to test whether is NULL, `alt_value`: The value to return if expression is NULL

### UNION 
```
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

### JOIN
* A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

* (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
* FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

#### INNER JOIN
* 这里的select columns指的是after join, 哪几个column会被display出来
* 注意： 和LEFT JOIN/RIGHT JOIN 不同的是只有both table 有的<ON KEY>才被保留下来
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

```

### FULL JOIN
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;
```

### UPDATE
* Used to modify the existing records in a table

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

### SELECT
```
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### SELECT DISTINCT
- statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
```
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
```

### DENSE_RANK (MySQL)
* The DENSE_RANK() is a window function that assigns a rank to each row within a partition or result set with no gaps in ranking values.

```
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY <expression>[{,<expression>...}]
    ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], [{,<expression>...}]
)
```

### WHERE
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```
SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE Country='Mexico';
```
### AND, NOT, OR
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
```

### SUBSTRING
```
SUBSTRING (<Column>, <Start> , <Length> ) 
```

### IN 
- case-insensitive
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

e.g., HackerRank SQL Weather Observation Station 8-11
```
# Query the non-depulicated list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 

# Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
# index -1 only works in MySQL
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, -1, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 

# Query the non-depulicated list of CITY names NOT starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'); 
```

### COLLATE
- You can make your query case sensitive by making use of the COLLATE keyword.
```
SELECT A 
FROM MyTbl 
WHERE A COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS = 'ABCdef'
```

### ORDER BY 
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

### COUNT, SUM, AVG, FLOOR, CEIL, MAX, MIN, ROUND, POWER, SQRT
- Only used in selection block
- 'Is' is one equal sign "=", not two "=="

```
# Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 1000000.
SELECT COUNT(ID)
FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION>100000;

SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT='California';
```

- `ROUND(number, decimals, operation)`: e.g., `ROUND(3.333, 2)-> 3.33`
- `POWER(number, power)`
- HackerRank Weather Observation Station 19


### MOD
- only on numerical 
`MOD(value, 2) = 1`

### REPLACE in str
`SELECT REPLACE('SQL Tutorial', 'T', 'M');`: replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring, the search is case-insensitive.

```
# works in mysql even when salary is an integer field, not a string field
# From the documentation "In MySQL, NUMERIC is implemented as DECIMAL, so the following remarks about DECIMAL apply equally to NUMERIC.", but CAST doesn't accept NUMERIC as target type (unlike DECIMAL).
# CAST not working in mysql here

# Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: correct-miscalculated average monthly salaries) from Employees db. Round to next integer
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(salary, '0', '')))
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```

### MySQL Not Support xx<A<xx

```
<!-- Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. 
Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.  -->

SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE 38.7880<LAT_N AND LAT_N<137.2345;
```

NOT working when write `38.7880<LAT_N<137.2345`.

### LIMIT

HackerRank: Weather Observation Station 15, 16

```
# Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than . Round your answer to  decimal places.
# MySQL

SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N<137.2345
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
LIMIT 1; 
```

HackerRank: Weather Observation Station 17

```
# Note MIN(LAT_N) cannot be used in WHERE block
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4)
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N>38.7780
ORDER BY LAT_N ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### CASE
```
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;
```

### Group By
* if group by multiple columns, group by their order in the command, e.g., first by col_a, then by col_b.
* The GROUP BY clause is used often used in conjunction with an aggregate function such as SUM() and AVG()
* it reduces the number of rows returned by rolling them up and calculating the sums or averages for each group.
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name_a, column_name_b (etc)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
### Having
* The HAVING clause is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups based on a specified condition. If the GROUP BY clause is omitted, the HAVING clause behaves like the WHERE clause.
* In this syntax, you specify a condition in the HAVING clause. If a row, which is generated by the group by clause, causes the group_condition to evaluate to true, the query will include it in the result set.
```

SELECT 
    select_list
FROM 
    table_name
WHERE 
    search_condition
GROUP BY 
    group_by_expression
HAVING 
    group_condition;
ORDER BY
    column
LIMIT 
    int
```

### PARTITION AS
* The PARTITION BY clause divides the result set into partitions and changes how the window function is calculated. The PARTITION BY clause does not reduce the number of rows returned.

```
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(salary) OVER (
        PARTITION BY department_id
    )) avg_department_salary
FROM
    employees;
```

### 177. Nth Highest Salary (Medium)
Select second highest salary 
- 括号要加对
- outside of return, has semi-colon
- offset means skip the first N-1. 
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
 DECLARE temp INT;
 SET temp = N-1;
  RETURN (
        SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC 
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET temp
  );
END
```

### DATE
* `MONTH(<DATE>), YEAR(<DATE>), DAY(<DATE>)`
* `ISDATE(<OBJ>)`: return 1 if OBJ is a date object, 0 else

### SUBSTRING
* `SUBSTRING('SQL Tutorial', 1, 3)-> 'SQL'`: start and end inclusive, index start from 1
* MYSQL: `LEFT("SQL Tutorial", 3)`: extract :3 character from a string

```
SELECT Score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score) FROM Scores AS s2 WHERE s2.Score>=s1.Score) AS Rank
FROM Scores AS s1
ORDER BY Rank ASC
```

### JOIN
* JOIN 是不能有ambiguous field， 如果两个table 都有这个field, 要确定是来自哪个table
* 相似题： 
    * 580. Count Student Number in Departments (Medium): 思考这边为什么是RIGHT JOIN而不是LEFT JOIN
    * 607. Sales Person. (Easy, 有意义的一题）Output all the names in the table salesperson, who didn’t have sales to company 'RED'. 难点就是利用JOIN使得company name!='RED'的人的company name那一个column为NULL。
    * 614. Second Degree Follower. (Medium, 有意思的一题)
    * 615. Average Salary: Department VS Company (Hard, 有意思的一题！)

## MySQL Client vs Server
* MySql Client : The mysql-client package allows you to connect to a MySQL server. It will give you the "mysql" command-line program.
* MySql Server : The mysql-server package allows to run a MySQL server which can host multiple databases and process queries on those databases.
* MySQL : The "MySQL" package probably includes both of the above.
If you just need to connect to a remote server and run queries, install just mysql-client. If you need to host a database, install the client and server.

## MYSQL GROUP BY settings
* 解：（1）MySQL的默认设置中有“only_full_group_by”，如果使用group by，那么select的对象必须是group by的相关对象，非常受限。所以往往会修改这个设置 by `SET sql_mode = '';`
原错误
```
SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'T.name' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY
```
