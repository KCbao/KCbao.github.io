## PATH

__What is PATH__

When you wish to install programs into other locations on your host, but be able to execute them easily without specifying their exact location. This can be easily done by adding a directory to your `$PATH`. 

__View PATH__

`echo $PATH`

__Install packages and add to path__

1. temporarily set path `export PATH=<your-dir>:$PATH`
2. permenantly set path: add `export PATH=<your-dir>:$PATH` in `.bashrc`. Then restart the terminal. 

## `which` vs `whereis`

__which__: returns the pathnames of the file which would be executed in the current enviroment 

__whereis__: searches for binary/source and manual page files. 

For example, 
```
whereis php => php: /usr/bin/php /usr/share/php /usr/share/man/man1/php.1.gz

# the php is executable, and some other stuff (e.g., man pages)

which php => /usr/bin/php
# returns only the php executable. 
```
