## Top Interview Questions (145 Questions)
* 主要思路：
* 知识点：
* 细节：

#### 2. Add two sums (medium)
* 主要思路： create a parent linked-list, and a child/dummy linked-list, dummy linked-list is moving ahead to update the linked-list, which will affect the parent linked-list

* 知识点： 1. Understand how linked-list works in Python <=> understand Python is a pass-by-object-reference language, not pass-by-reference 2. use "carry" to carry module and add remainder to parent linked-list by updating dummy linked-list 3. learn how to use "%" (divider), and "//" (remainder) syntax

* 细节：1. if `l1==None`, `l1.val`&`l1.next` not exist becuz "Nonetype doesn't have a value/next". Need to consider if-else to counter this case 2. what is the stopping criterion for the loop 3. how to update the linked-list, especially when `l.next==None`.

#### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (medium)
* 主要思路：sliding window, two-pointer
* 知识点：sliding window
* 细节： 1. time and space complexity, 2. add element to set `set.add(1)`, it is in-place addition

#### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
* 主要思路：
* 知识点：
* 细节: 

#### Sliding window
* Use case: any problem where it is asking for any of the following return values can use a sliding window: Minimum value, Maximum value, Longest value, Shortest value, K-sized value. 
* Applied to what data type: strings, arrays, and even linked lists.
* Sliding window algorithm: 1. a starting pointer 2. a Set (in Python) or Object (in JS) or Hash table (in other languages) to check for duplicates, hash table look up time is O(1) 3. loop: loop declares rule on when to increment left/right pointer. 
* Why need set? set is used to help determine where the left pointer shall locate so that the window contains no duplicates
* test example : "pwwkew", max non-dup substring len = 3
* Time complexity: O(n): n is length of the data
* Space complexity: O(n)

#### Dynamical programming
A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc).
