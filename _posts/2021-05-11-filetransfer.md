## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
* It is a client/server network protocol used to transfer files over the Internet. FTP clients are used to send and retrieve files to and from servers which store files and respond to requests from clients.

## SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
* It is a file transfer protocol that leverages a set of utilities that provide **secure access** to a remote computer to deliver secure communications.
* It leverages SSH (Secure Socket Shell or Secure Shell)
* Secure FTP also compresses all data during the transmission, which can result in faster file transfers.
