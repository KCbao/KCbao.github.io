## Tensor

__grad_fn__

Each variable has a `.grad_fn` attribute that references a function that has created a function (except for Tensors created by the user, these have `None` as `.grad_fn`). 

For example, we create `x=torch.ones(2,2, requires_grad=True)`, then `x.grad_fn = None`, since we create the tensor `x` ourselves. And for `y=x+2`, then `y is tensor([[3,3]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)`. 

When run `y_pred = model(X_test_tensor)`, get the following error
`RuntimeError: Expected object of scalar type Float but got scalar type Double for xxxxx`. 
Solve by `y_pred = model(X_test_tensor.float())`. 

## Watch GPU usage
`watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi`

## Multi-gpu, results is a list

item 0 in the list, is results assigned to gpu 0
1, 1. 
etc
