__SkyHook__
* Skyhook hybrids positioning technology, incorporates Wi-Fi, GPS, cell towers, IP address and device sensors, to identify device location precisely.
* As of 2020. Skyhook's coverage area includes most major metro areas in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The system can also be used to enhance the performance of GPS enabled devices where GPS reception is weak.


__IMSI-catcher (伪基站)__
* IMSI: international mobile subscriber identity-catche
* Used for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking location data of mobile phone users.
* Essentially a "fake" mobile tower acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
* It can search for GSM mobile phone information within a certain radius centered on it, and arbitrarily use other people’s mobile phone numbers to force the direction. The user's mobile phone sends spam messages such as fraud and sales promotion, which are usually sent in a car or a relatively hidden place. When the pseudo base station is running, the user's mobile phone signal is forcibly connected to the device and cannot be connected to the public telecommunication network, which affects the normal use of mobile phone users. 


__GPS: Triangulation vs Trilateration__
* !["assets/Triangulation.jpg"](/assets/images/Trilateration.jpg)
* Trilateration uses known distances to pinpoint precise locations, triangulation uses known angles to calculate unknown distances. 

__LTE vs GSM__
* LTE, aka 4G LTE, is a type of 4G technology
* GSM is a 2G. 


__x86 vs x64 vs ARM__
* x86/x64 processors: They’re fast and powerful, but they require a lot of electricity. So, they’re used in desktop computers that can plug into the wall. All versions of Windows run on x86/x64.

* ARM processors: They’re weak but low-power processors for smartphones and other devices that aren’t plugged into the wall. Mobile iOS and Android operating systems run on ARM.

* The two processor architectures are mutually exclusive: a program that’s built for x86/x64 can’t run on ARM under any circumstances, and vice versa.
