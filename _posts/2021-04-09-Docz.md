## What is Docz?
During React development, we often create many components. These components can be reused in other applications. Just like Material-UI creates a lot of components such as Buttons, Sliders etc. Docz is used to build and maintain cutom documentation sites. 

### Get Started
* add docz to an exisiting project `npm install docz`, `docz` will now appear in `package.json`. 
* add `docz: dev": "docz dev", docz:build": "docz build", "docz:serve": "docz build && docz serve"` in `package.json` under `scripts` block. 
* create a .mdx file anywhere in your project. 
* `npm run docz:dev`: this will build a documentation app folder named ".docz" under your root folder.
